# Dotfiles Manager - Development Progress

## üìã **Project Overview**

### **üéØ Original Goal**
Build a cross-platform Dotfiles Manager in Go that:
- Supports Windows 11, macOS, and Linux
- Has templating engine for flexible dotfile structure
- Integrates with package managers (choco/winget, brew, apt/yum/dnf)
- Works with multiple shells (PowerShell, Bash, ZSH)
- Uses single Go binary with no external dependencies

### **üèÜ Key Design Decisions**
- **Go-only approach** - No shell scripts, everything in Go for true cross-platform compatibility
- **Single binary** - Self-contained with embedded templates and defaults
- **Go install compatibility** - Users install with `go install github.com/vleeuwenmenno/dotfiles-cp/cmd/dotfiles@latest`
- **Custom build system** - `build.go` script instead of Makefiles
- **Clear command naming** - `apply` for applying dotfiles, `update` for updating tool itself

## ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete - Foundation**

### **What's Working**

1. **Cross-platform Build System**
   - `build.go` script that works on Windows, macOS, Linux
   - No dependency on make, bash, or PowerShell scripts
   - Builds for all target platforms: `go run build.go -all`
   - Development tools: test, format, clean, install

2. **Platform Detection** (`internal/platform/`)
   - OS detection (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Architecture detection (amd64, arm64)
   - Shell detection (PowerShell, CMD, Bash, ZSH)
   - Package manager detection (chocolatey, winget, scoop, homebrew, apt, yum/dnf, pacman, etc.)
   - Environment information (home directory, config directory, elevated privileges)

3. **Logging System** (`internal/logger/`)
   - Beautiful console output with zerolog
   - Configurable log levels (verbose, quiet, normal)
   - Color-coded output with timestamps

4. **CLI Framework** (`cmd/dotfiles/`)
   - Professional CLI with Cobra
   - Global flags: --verbose, --quiet
   - Complete command structure defined

5. **Utility Functions** (`pkg/utils/`)
   - File operations (exists, copy, backup)
   - Path expansion (~ to home directory)
   - Symlink management
   - Cross-platform path utilities

6. **Configuration Structure** (`internal/config/`)
   - Basic structs defined for YAML configuration
   - Viper integration for config parsing
   - Validation framework started

### **Command Structure (Complete)**

```bash
# Setup & Management
dotfiles init          # Initialize new dotfiles repo
dotfiles apply         # Apply dotfiles configuration to system
dotfiles backup        # Backup current config files
dotfiles restore       # Restore from backup

# Maintenance & Info
dotfiles status        # Show what's applied, what's changed
dotfiles validate      # Check configuration file
dotfiles info          # Platform information
dotfiles version       # Version information

# Updates
dotfiles update        # Update the tool itself
dotfiles update --check # Check for tool updates
```

### **Dependencies**
- `github.com/spf13/cobra` - CLI framework
- `github.com/rs/zerolog` - Logging
- `github.com/spf13/viper` - Configuration management
- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` - YAML parsing

## üéØ **Planned Configuration Structure**

I'd like to make it so that every dotfiles repository starts with a `dotfiles.yaml` file in the root directory. From there the application will load the configuration and apply it to the dotfiles.

There's also a variables/ folder which contains yaml files that get loaded for the template system.
Every/any folder inside variables/ that starts with index.yaml will be loaded first. From there imports could be done to load additional variables.

Same with state/ and any other folder that starts with index.yaml.
Under state/ are the template files that actually get processed for the dotfiles stuff.

the `dotfiles.yaml` file in the root allows the user to configure these paths to different locations and the index.yaml to different names if they so desire.

## üöß **Phase 2 - Core Implementation (Next)**

### **What Needs Implementation**

1. **Configuration System** (`internal/config/`)
   - [ ] YAML file parsing and loading
   - [ ] Configuration validation
   - [ ] Platform matching logic
   - [ ] Variable merging (global + platform-specific)
   - [ ] Default configuration generation

2. **Templating Engine** (`internal/template/`)
   - [ ] Go template processing
   - [ ] Custom template functions
   - [ ] Variable substitution
   - [ ] Conditional logic support
   - [ ] File inclusion/composition

3. **Package Management** (`internal/packages/`)
   - [ ] Package manager integration
   - [ ] Installation commands for each manager
   - [ ] Dependency resolution
   - [ ] Error handling and retry logic

4. **File Management** (`internal/files/`)
   - [ ] Symlink creation and management
   - [ ] File backup before changes
   - [ ] Conflict resolution
   - [ ] Directory structure creation
   - [ ] Permission handling

5. **Core Apply Logic** (`internal/apply/`)
   - [ ] Main apply workflow
   - [ ] Platform detection and matching
   - [ ] Package installation orchestration
   - [ ] File processing and deployment
   - [ ] Rollback on errors

### **Command Implementations Needed**

```bash
dotfiles init      # Create sample dotfiles.yaml + directory structure
dotfiles apply     # Main functionality - apply configuration
dotfiles backup    # Backup current files before apply
dotfiles restore   # Restore from backup
dotfiles status    # Show what's applied, what would change
dotfiles validate  # Validate dotfiles.yaml syntax and logic
```

## üß™ **Testing Strategy (Phase 3)**

### **Test Categories**
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions and utilities
2. **Integration Tests** - Cross-platform functionality
3. **Template Tests** - Template rendering and variables
4. **Configuration Tests** - YAML parsing and validation
5. **Platform Tests** - Different OS/shell combinations

### **Test Infrastructure**
- GitHub Actions for cross-platform CI
- Test fixtures for different configurations
- Mock package managers for testing
- Temporary file system for file operations

## üì¶ **Deployment Strategy**

### **Release Process**
1. **Versioning** - Semantic versioning with Git tags
2. **Cross-platform Builds** - GitHub Actions build matrix
3. **Binary Releases** - Attach binaries to GitHub releases
4. **Go Module** - Tagged releases for `go install`

### **Distribution Channels**
- **Primary**: `go install` for Go users
- **Future**: Package managers (brew, choco, apt)
- **Fallback**: Direct binary downloads

## üéØ **Next Planning Session Agenda**

### **Critical Design Decisions Needed**

1. **Configuration Loading Strategy**
   - Where to look for dotfiles.yaml?
   - How to handle missing configuration?
   - Should we support multiple config files?

2. **Template Function Library**
   - What custom functions to provide?
   - How to handle platform-specific logic in templates?
   - Variable scoping and inheritance?

3. **Package Installation Strategy**
   - Should we run package managers with elevated privileges?
   - How to handle package manager failures?
   - Should we support package version pinning?

4. **File Management Strategy**
   - Symlinks vs file copies?
   - How to handle existing files?
   - Backup strategy and cleanup?

5. **Error Handling Philosophy**
   - Fail fast vs continue on errors?
   - How much rollback capability?
   - User interaction for conflicts?

6. **Repository Structure**
   - What should `dotfiles init` generate?
   - How to organize templates and configs?
   - Examples and starter templates?

## üöÄ **Ready for Phase 2**

The foundation is solid and battle-tested. All major architectural decisions are made, the build system works flawlessly across platforms, and the command structure is clear and intuitive.

**Next session should focus on:**
1. Detailed implementation planning for Phase 2
2. Configuration file format finalization
3. Template engine design
4. Apply workflow design
5. Testing strategy

**Status: Foundation Complete ‚úÖ - Ready for Core Implementation üöÄ**
